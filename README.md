CourseraMachineLearningMP2
==========================
Implementing Andrew Ng's Coursera machine learning MP2 in python
In python there is a lot of optimization, fmin_ncg, fmin_bfgs
I am in no position understanding the algorithm that lay inside it.
But only some of the optimization algorithm work for this MP2.
For example fmin_ncg might not work but fmin_bfgs might work and vice versa
I have no idea why, so I just try to run all the optimization and see which one give me
the best result, then I used it
